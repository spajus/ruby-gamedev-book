# Making The Prototype Playable

Right now we have a somewhat playable, but boring prototype without any scores or winning
conditions. You can just run around and shoot other tanks. Nobody would play a game like this,
hence we need to to add the missing parts. There is a crazy amount of them. It is time to give it a
thorough play through and write down all the ideas and pain points about the prototype.

Here is my list:

1. Enemy tanks do not respawn.
2. Enemy tanks shoot at my current location, not at where I will be when bullet
hits me.
3. Enemy tanks don't avoid collisions.
4. Random maps are boring and lack detail, could use more tiles or random environment objects.
5. Bullets are hard to see on green surface.
6. Hard to tell where enemies are coming from, radar would help.
7. Sounds play at full volume even when something happens across the whole map.
8. My tank should respawn after it's dead.
9. Motion and firing mechanics seem clumsy.
10. Map boundaries are visible when you come to the edge.
11. Enemy tank movement patterns need polishing and improvement.

This will keep us busy for a while, but in the end we will probably have something that will
hopefully be able to entertain people for more than 3 minutes.
