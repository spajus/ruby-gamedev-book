# What You Should Know Before Reading This Book

As you can read on the cover, this book is "for those who write code for living". It's
not a requirement, and you will most likely be able to understand everything even if you are a
student or hobbyist, but this book will not teach you how to be a good programmer. If you want to
learn that, start with timeless classic: [The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to
Master](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4099.The_Pragmatic_Programmer).

This book will also not teach you the basics of Ruby. There are plenty of books and resources
covering that subject. Try
[Why's Poignant Guide To Ruby](http://mislav.uniqpath.com/poignant-guide/) or
[Eloquent Ruby](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9364729-eloquent-ruby). You can also learn it
while reading this book. It shouldn't be too hard, especially if you already write code for living.
After all programming language is merely a tool, and when you learn one, others are relatively
easy to switch to.

You should know how to use the command line. Basic knowledge of [Git](http://git-scm.com/) is also
required.

One important thing. You don't have to know how to draw or compose music. We will use media that is
available for free. However, knowledge of graphics and audio editing software won't hurt.
