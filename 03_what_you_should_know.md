# What You Should Know Before Reading This Book

As you can read on the cover, this book is dedicated "for those who write code for living". It's
not a requirement, and you will most likely be able to understand everything even if you are a
student or hobbyist, but this book will not teach you how to be a good programmer. If you want to
learn that, start with timeless classic: [The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to
Master](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4099.The_Pragmatic_Programmer).

This book will also not teach you the basics of Ruby. There are plenty of books and resources
covering that subject. Try
[Why's Poignant Guide To Ruby](http://mislav.uniqpath.com/poignant-guide/),
[Eloquent Ruby](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9364729-eloquent-ruby). You can also learn it
while reading this book. It shouldn't be too hard, especially if you already write code for living.
After all programming language is merely a tool, and when you learn one, others are relatively
easy to switch to.
