# Creating Artificial Intelligence

Artificial Intelligence is a subject so vast that we will barely scratch the surface.
[AI in Video Games](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence_(video_games))
is usually heavily simplified and therefore easier to implement.

There is this wonderful series of articles called
[Designing Artificial Intelligence for Games](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/designing-artificial-intelligence-for-games-part-1/)
that I highly recommend reading to get a feeling how game AI should be done. We will be
continuing our work on top of what we already have, example code for this chapter will be in `06-ai`.
